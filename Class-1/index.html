    <p class="para pcommon" id="content">In English, Namak Swaad Anusaar means, salt to taste. However, home chef jasleen marwah took Namak Swaad Anusaar to another level. For her, it means, ” Life Your Way. “

        Raised up in Kashmir in her early childhood years, she developed immense love and passion for the place, it’s culture and of course food. Jasleen is a self taught chef. She learnt the magic of salt and spices by trying her hand at cooking.
        
        From Authentic Kashmiri and Punjabi cuisine to International cuisine comprising Thai, Italian, Chinese and Continental , her culinery skills are unmatched. She has tie ups with restaurants and a food blog under the same name – Namak Swaad Anusaar.
        
        In a conversation with Jasleen over a hot cup of coffee, I couldnt help but ask her, “Why Namak Swaad Anusaar? ” She smiled and replied ,” Because I was always into media. I chose to dwell into food industry because of my love for cooking which I never considered professionally. “
        
        Namak Swaad Anusaar involves activities like home pop ups, restaurant tie ups, consulting and catering. Her future plan is to start a Delivery Kitchen or a proper Restaurant.
        
        Well, Jasleen Marwah wish you all the best from the team of #writersnextdoor.
